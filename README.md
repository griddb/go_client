GridDB Go Client

## Overview

GridDB Go Client is developed using GridDB C Client and [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator).

## QuickStart (CentOS, Ubuntu)
### Preparations

Install SWIG as below.

    $ wget https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-3.0.12.tar.gz
    $ tar xvfz swig-3.0.12.tar.gz
    $ cd swig-3.0.12
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
   
    Note: If CentOS, you might need to install pcre in advance.
    $ sudo yum install pcre2-devel.x86_64

Install Go.

Install [GridDB Server](https://github.com/griddb/griddb_nosql) and [C Client](https://github.com/griddb/c_client). 

Note: 
- If you build Server or C Client from source code, please use GCC 4.8.5.
- If you build C Client from source code, please set LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    Ex.)  
    $ export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$C_CLIENT_HOME/bin  
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$C_CLIENT_HOME/bin

### Build and Run 

    1. Set the GOPATH variable for Go module files.

    2. Get Go client source code.

        $ go get github.com/griddb/go_client

    3. Run script to generate resource and install Go client

        $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.comgriddb/go_client
        $ ./run_swig.sh
        $ go install

    4. Import "github.com/griddb/go_client" in Go.

### How to run sample

GridDB Server need to be started in advance.

    1. The command to run sample

        $ go run sample/sample1.go <GridDB notification address> <GridDB notification port>
            <GridDB cluster name> <GridDB user> <GridDB password>
          -->Person: name=name02 status=false count=1 lob=[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74]

## QuickStart (Windows)
### Preparations

Install SWIG as below.
- Download zip package from https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/swigwin-3.0.12/swigwin-3.0.12.zip/download
- Extract the zip package then set PATH variable for swig tool.

Install GO
- Download and install package from https://dl.google.com/go/go1.12.8.windows-amd64.msi

Install [GridDB Server](https://github.com/griddb/griddb_nosql) on CentOS. (Note: If you build them from source code, please use GCC 4.8.5.) 

Install GridDB C Client.
- Please refer to https://github.com/griddb/c_client to install GridDB C client.
- After installing GridDB C client, create folder <go_client>\libs and store gridstore_c.dll (not use gridstore_c.lib) into it.

Set LIBRARY_PATH.

    $ set LIBRARY_PATH=%LIBRARY_PATH%:<C client library file directory path>

Install tdm64-gcc
- Download and install package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm64-gcc-5.1.0-2.exe/download

### Build and Run in cmd

    1. Set the GOPATH variable for Go module files.

    2. Get Go client source code.

        $ go get github.com/griddb/go_client

    3. Run script to generate resource and install Go client

        $ cd %GOPATH%/src/github.com/griddb/go_client
        $ ./run_swig.bat
        $ go install

    4. Import "github.com/griddb/go_client" in Go.

### How to run sample

GridDB Server need to be started in advance.

    1. Set PATH

        $ set PATH=%PATH%:<C client library file directory path>

    2. The command to run sample

        $ go run sample/sample1.go <GridDB notification address> <GridDB notification port>
            <GridDB cluster name> <GridDB user> <GridDB password>
          -->[ 'name01', false, 1, <Buffer 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 4a> ]

## Function

(available)
- STRING, BOOL, BYTE, SHORT, INTEGER, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE, TIMESTAMP, BLOB type for GridDB
- put single row, get row with key
- normal query, aggregation with TQL
- Multi-Put/Get/Query (batch processing)

(not available)
- GEOMETRY, Array type for GridDB
- timeseries compression
- timeseries-specific function like gsAggregateTimeSeries, gsQueryByTimeSeriesSampling in C client
- trigger, affinity

Please refer to the following files for more detailed information.  
- [Go Client API Reference](https://griddb.github.io/go_client/GoAPIReference.htm)

Note:
1. After calling a method getting GridDB object, user must call DeleteClassName() function for each object.
   If possible, we recommend to use a defer of the DeleteClassName call like sample1.go.
2. The current API might be changed in the next version. e.g. ContainerInfo()
